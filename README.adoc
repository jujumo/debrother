Brief: When I use the charger of my scanner for duplex (recto-verso) scanning,
files stored in complete mess. Since the manufacturer does not provide
proper tools to do duplex, I wrote this simple tool (python);
It sorts the pages (files) of the scan in the correct order.

NOTE: Tis is designed for brother multi-function (mfc-L2710DW) printer-scanner.
This tool is untested for other devices, but if you have tested other devices,
please, share me the results.
